Has your DB server died in the fire of a dozen Quad core Xeon's maxed out at 100% CPU usage 24/7?

Is your ORM misbehaving and issuing horrific queries?

If so Watson is the tool for you - it helps you track down the bad queries in your ORM and fix them.

**Still under development**

Currently, code focuses on methods to hook into doctrine to gather stats for performance measuring.
You may still find this useful as it currently will add a -- /full/path/to/file.php:line_no comment to
all queries generated by the ORM.

 Future development plans are to log stats against queries
 (execution time, hydration time, rows/entity ratio) giving you the ability to dig into the
 worst performing parts of your code and improve them.
